        Hi, I'm Jhon â€” passionate about math, software, and learning how things
        actually work. I started coding in 2019 with Java, but eventually found
        joy in building complete experiences using JavaScript, TypeScript, and
        ReactJS.

<div class="mx-auto mt-2 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
  <p>
    Currently studying data science engineering with an eye on AI, algebraic
    structures, and software development. I enjoy creating interfaces, exploring
    the "why" behind algorithms, and building things that feel good to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not deep into code or a textbook, you'll find me biking or hiking,
    trying to compose some music, or just vibing with some nonfiction or
    writing.
