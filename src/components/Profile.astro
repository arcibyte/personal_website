        Hi, I'm Jhon â€” passionate about math, software, and learning how things
        actually work. I started coding in 2019 with Java, but eventually found
        joy in building complete experiences using JavaScript, TypeScript, and
        ReactJS.

    Currently studying data science engineering with an eye on AI, algebraic
    structures, and software development. I enjoy creating interfaces, exploring
    the "why" behind algorithms, and building things that feel good to use.

    When I'm not deep into code or a textbook, you'll find me biking or hiking,
    trying to compose some music, or just vibing with some nonfiction or
    writing.
