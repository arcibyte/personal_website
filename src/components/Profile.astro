      Hi, I'm Jhon â€” passionate about math, software, and learning how things
      actually work. I started coding in 2019 with Java, but eventually found
      joy in building complete experiences using JavaScript, TypeScript, and
      ReactJS.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Currently studying data science engineering with an eye on AI, algebraic
      structures, and software development. I enjoy creating interfaces,
      exploring the "why" behind algorithms, and building things that feel good
      to use.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      When I'm not deep into code or a textbook, you'll find me biking or
      hiking, trying to compose some music, or just vibing with some nonfiction
      or writing.
