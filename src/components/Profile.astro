        Hi, i'm Jhon - passionate about math, software and learning how things
        actually work. I started coding in 2019 with Java, but eventually found
        joy in building complete experiences using Javascript, Typescript and
        ReactJS.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Currently studying data science engineering with an eye on IA, algebraic
        structures, and software development. I like creating interfaces,
        exploring the why behind algorithms, and building things that feel good
        to use.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        when i'm not deep into code or a textbook, you'll find me biking or
        hiking, trying to compose some sound, or just vibing with some
        nonfiction or writing.
